Towers-something/ defence

Design Doc
Name 2D Tower Defence
Player mechanics
Build function
Tower upgrades


Game is for anyone, simple problem solving to defeat enemies. Kids to early adults.
At this point a single level, reasonably big and Tower defence.
Looking at maybe using value system of shapes, or use assets from unity store for turret but keeping the models simple as its not what makes the game.
