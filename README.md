Game is for anyone, simple problem solving to defeat enemies. Kids to early adults
At this point a single level, reasonably big, Tower defence
Looking at maybe using value system of shapes, or use assets from unity store for turret but keeping the models simple as its not what makes the game.
SO Week 6-7

•	Enemy move from A-B then destroyed at B
•	Simply game cycle start, play, menu to restart or quit
